# Monktoberfest Code of Conduct

RedMonk is committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all Monktoberfest participants, including but not limited to attendees, sponsors, vendors, guests, and employees (collectively referred to as “participants”). To help us meet this goal, we’ve created the following code of conduct that outlines our expectations for Monktoberfest participants and we expect it to be honored. Anyone who violates the code of conduct may be asked to leave and/or banned from participating in future Monktoberfest and other RedMonk events. This code of conduct also includes how to report unacceptable behavior. We encourage anyone who experiences or witnesses unacceptable behavior to follow the reporting steps. We can only address those issues that are brought to our attention. Although this code is not exhaustive or complete, it serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment, and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter. While at the Monktoberfest, we expect participants to:

- **Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient:** We communicate openly, assume good intentions, and do our best to act in an empathetic fashion. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
- **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
- **Be considerate**: We treat each other with respect at all times. While our levels of education or experience may vary, we all have something to contribute. As a result, we are thoughtful in our dialogue and take care to give others the chance to speak without being talked over.
- **Be careful in the words that you choose**: We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
  - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  - Discriminatory jokes and language.
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  - Unwelcome sexual attention.
  - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
- **When we disagree, try to understand why**: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.

### **Diversity Statement**

RedMonk is committed to building a community for all and we encourages everyone to participate in the Monktoberfest. Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities. Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we all agree that everyone is equal.

### **Reporting Issues**

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting us via codeofconduct@redmonk.com. All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:

- Your contact information.
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g., a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please include a link.
- Any additional information that may be helpful.

After filing a report, a RedMonk employee will contact you personally. If the person who is harassing you is a RedMonk employee, that person will be recused from reviewing, participating, or otherwise handling your report. RedMonk will then review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond. We will act with complete discretion in addressing all complaints, and unless otherwise legally required, we will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. RedMonk will make every effort to address incidents as quickly and as thoroughly as possible.Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, RedMonk may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a permanent ban from our community, the Monktoberfest, and/or future RedMonk events, with or without warning.

## **Thanks**

This code of conduct is based on the [Open Code of Conduct](https://github.com/todogroup/opencodeofconduct) from the [TODOGroup](http://todogroup.org/).We are thankful for their work and all the communities who have paved the way with code of conducts.
