Interested in speaking at Monktoberfest? The [call for proposals](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdfUg-AxEQJcf5qCj0WNGahkoYLBMChOo9_DGCTrQwlSt0T2A/viewform?formkey=dFJuRTRWNVRkSUhpcFhDR0lKb3htZ2c6MQ) is open.

We welcome talk proposals from people at all levels, from first time speakers to those with years of experience. While we don't require previous speaking experience, a commonality in our speakers is that they have an engaging and insightful story to tell.

Submissions should touch on both themes of social and technology, though how you define those terms is up to you.

Keep in mind that we are a single track conference. There is no hard deadline for submissions, but we encourage early submissions given our limited speaking slots.

Please check out the [submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdfUg-AxEQJcf5qCj0WNGahkoYLBMChOo9_DGCTrQwlSt0T2A/viewform?formkey=dFJuRTRWNVRkSUhpcFhDR0lKb3htZ2c6MQ) for an FAQ and more details about submitting a talk.
