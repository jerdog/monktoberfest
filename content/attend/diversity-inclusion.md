[**Applications for the 2025 Monktoberfest are OPEN**!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf104xmsWIfLwMrmOxSeToeIihgg9UnC8eHxSoJvdXfwWirvg/viewform)

Our goal for Monktoberfest is to create a conference at which everyone feels welcome and valued. We are excited to help foster this inclusive environment through our diversity and inclusion program.

If you are a member of an under-represented group in tech and would like to join us at The Monktoberfest, please consider applying.

We'd like to help make Monktoberfest accessible to groups historically under-represented or excluded in the technology sector, including but not limited to women, people of color, LGBTQ+, and/or people with disabilities. Our definition of under-represented groups is tech is intentionally wide. We don’t exclude anyone on the basis of ability, class, color, gender, or creed.

Our goal is to support folks from under-represented groups before, during, and after the event. We want to do more than just give away a free ticket, but hope instead to help remove other potential barriers to participation. We provide:

-  a comped ticket to the conference

-  a travel and lodging stipend to help you make your way up to Maine

- conference meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner on Thursday. breakfast on Friday.)

- a welcoming community who is excited to meet you!

**Want to be involved?** While we're excited to make the conference financially accessible for people, we'd also like to make it socially accessible. We recognize that walking into a room full of strangers can be intimidating, and we'd like to mitigate some of the resulting stress by creating a light touch social support network. If you'd like to be part of that network of friendly faces, [hit us up](mailto:monktoberfest@redmonk.com) and we'll let you know how you can participate during the conference!
