As the organizers of the event, we want to make sure that everyone knows what to expect with respect to COVID, our related preparations, and our ability to hold the event.

If we determine that it's not safe to hold the event, we will not hold the event. We're hard at work planning and preparing, but we will of course postpone to keep people safe if that becomes necessary.

Speaking of planning, three other things you need to know before attending:

- **Masks**: Masks will not be mandatory, but those that wish to wear masks certainly will have our full support (and many of us will be masked ourselves). To be clear this is not a statement on our part about masks, which we believe in strongly, but strictly a function of the realities of our space and people eating and drinking during the event. We wanted to be clear on this up front.
- **Testing**: We will be conducting COVID testing. Every attendee will need to test daily (Thurs/Fri) before they will be allowed to attend the event. In previous years we had guests upload their test results to an online portal; this year will be a bit different. We will be checking for physical negative tests at the door of the venue. Attendees will be responsible for securing and bringing their own tests to the event, but RedMonk will have some available on hand to test on-site if necessary. Attendees that do not clear the tests will unfortunately not be able to attend the event but we will of course refund their tickets immediately.
- **Ventilation**: We will maximize ventilation for the event in two ways: opening windows for airflow by leveraging multiple high quality portable air filtration devices.

If you have any questions not answered here, or if you have a ticket but can no longer make it, contact [monktoberfest@redmonk.com](mailto:monktoberfest@redmonk.com) and we'll get the questions answered or the tickets refunded.
