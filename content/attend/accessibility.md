RedMonk is committed to providing an inclusive environment, and we will do our best to meet the needs of all our attendees and speakers. This page describes some of the accessibility considerations we have taken into account for Monktoberfest. Please contact us if your question is not answered here, or if the arrangements as described are not sufficient for your needs. We will work with you to the best of our ability to make the conference accessible.

### What is the conference space like?

The venue is fully ADA‑compliant. The entrance is street‑level with no steps or ramps required—great for wheelchair users or anyone with mobility needs.

With 6,800 sq ft of open space, the room is configured for seated presentations and mixed standing/social.

### How much walking or standing is needed?

Halo on the Point is an open-concept space. Typically, guests stand or walk around, and there are chairs set up around the presentation space.

As a single-track conference, there is no need to relocate once you've entered the venue. Lunch is served in the same room, and we explicitly design the day to include plenty of breaks so attendees can eat, mingle and chat.

Both the welcome event and dinner are designed for interaction and mingling, but there are chairs and tables readily available in both venues.

### What are the arrangements for presenters?

The stage is floor level. The lectern is not height-adjustable and has about enough surface area for a laptop and a bottle of water. The microphone stand is on the lectern.

Please let us know if you need any assistance to make your presentation successful, be it an alternative microphone setup, a stool or other support, additional space to display an element of your presentation, or anything else we haven't thought of.

### Will the speakers and Q&A participants use a microphone?

Yes, speakers will use a microphone.

In addition, we will have live captioning at the event to visually transcribe the talks in real-time.

### What are the restroom facilities like?

The restrooms are located directly outside the main room. They are stalled restrooms with handicapped accommodations.

### Will the conference accommodate special dietary needs?

We work hard to provide a variety of food choices at every meal, including gluten-free, dairy-free, vegetarian, and vegan options. Meals and snacks are served buffet-style so you can select the items that work for you.

### I'm concerned about the presence of alcohol / I don't drink alcohol.

For those who don't drink, we have your back! All meals have non-alcoholic beverage options available. Also, please know that the food is a first class citizen at the event (to give you a sense, here are some of the things we've featured in past years: lobster that was literally caught that same morning as the conference dinner. a raw bar. sushi buffet. carving stations. mac & cheese bar. cooked-to-order noodles. freshly scooped gelato. you get the idea.) With or without the beer pairing, these meals will have something for everyone.

For those who are concerned about others drinking, please note:

\- We expect all attendees to consume alcohol responsibly and be in control of their behavior while drinking. Attendees should be mindful of how much they've had to drink and not over-consume. We do not permit lowered inhibitions to lower the standards of acceptable behavior. Alcohol does not excuse people's actions or reduce accountability for behavior. Period.
\- We have a strictly enforced code of conduct that applies to all conference events.
\- Per the state's liquor laws, all alcohol is served by authorized servers. We do not serve visibly intoxicated people.
\- We do not permit minors at the event given the presence of alcohol.

### Can you accommodate breastfeeding or nursing moms?

While we don't have space set aside exclusively for this purpose, we can definitely help you find a quiet, private room and can provide refrigeration. Please contact us and we can help you make a plan.

### What if I have a medical emergency or health problem during the conference?

You can seek immediate medical attention at nearby hospitals and urgent care clinics, including [Maine Medical Center](https://mainehealth.org/maine-medical-center), [Mercy Hospital](https://www.mercyhospital.org/), and [ConvenientMD Urgent Care Clinic](https://convenientmd.com/locations/portland-me-urgent-care-04101/). Nearby pharmacies include [CVS](https://www.cvs.com/store-locator/cvs-pharmacy-address/510+Congress+Street-Portland-ME-04101/storeid=454?WT.mc_id=LS_GOOGLE_FS_454) and [RiteAid](https://locations.riteaid.com/locations/me/portland/290-congress-street.html).

(These references are based on proximity to the venue. Please do your own due diligence before seeking medical care!)
