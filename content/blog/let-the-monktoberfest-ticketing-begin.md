Brothers and Sisters,

You have all been very patient, now it is time. Tickets are as of this moment officially on sale.

But only for you, the chosen. Remember that the link below is being made available to you early as thanks for your interest and support. Please respect your colleagues; we ask that you not distribute the link and password information. We have a very limited number of seats available, and we want all of you to have the first opportunity to secure them. At this time tomorrow morning, we will open up the remaining tickets to any and all comers. Until Wednesday then, a vow of silence please.

To purchase a ticket - only one per person\* - to the Monktoberfest, sign in using the link below. You will need this password to access the link: ORVAL. Tickets are sold on a first come, first serve basis.

[http://monktoberfest.eventbrite.com/](http://monktoberfest.eventbrite.com "Monktoberfest Tickets")

One important note for sponsors: the only sponsorships that come with seats to the conference are our Trappist or Abbot level packages. If you have not purchased one of those, you do need to buy a seat. Contact us if you have any questions about that.

Otherwise, we hope to see all of you in October. This will be a conference like no other.

Sincerely,

The Monks

\\* If you'd like to purchase more than one seat, please contact Stephen O'Grady (sogrady@redmonk.com) for details.
