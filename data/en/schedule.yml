  content : "**Monktoberfest** is a day and a half of single track sessions, with a relaxed schedule that will allow for an equally rewarding hallway track. We do not disclose our speaker list in advance (<a href=/blog/why-the-monktoberfest-agenda-is-not-disclosed.md>here’s the rationale about why</a>), but we recognize that it can be helpful to have a general sense of what to expect from a conference. You can get a sense of content you can expect by looking at talks from our previous events and recaps from the team.<p>Below is a high-level agenda of what you can expect for the 2025 event.</p>"

          **Venue:** CASCO BAY LINES ([location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sffy6Qhv6VwpFjvJ7))<br />

          <p>Attendees arriving the night before the conference will be treated to a special welcome event. If you can make it to the Portland waterfront by 5:15, we will be buying you a few of the best local beers while we take a sunset cruise around the Casco Bay. Bring warm layers suitable for going out on the water.</p>

          <p>While we will provide a few things to nibble on, we won’t have a full meal on the boat so plan accordingly. We’ll turn you all loose to grab dinner at one of the dozens of nationally renowned restaurants in the neighborhood upon our return to port.</p>

          <p>Getting in to town late?

We’ll be back to grab food and drinks with you around 8:30.</p>
